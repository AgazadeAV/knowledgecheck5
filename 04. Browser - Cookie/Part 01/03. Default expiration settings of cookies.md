**Default Expiration Settings of Cookies**

Cookies are an essential part of web development, used to store small amounts of data in a user's browser. One of the key aspects of cookies is their expiration settings, which determine how long the browser will retain them. Understanding the default expiration behavior is crucial for implementing cookies effectively.

### **Default Expiration Settings**

1. **Session Cookies (Default Behavior):**  
   By default, if no expiration date or `Max-Age` is specified, a cookie is considered a session cookie.  
   - **Duration:** Session cookies exist only while the browser is open. Once the browser is closed, these cookies are automatically deleted.  
   - **Use Case:** Commonly used for temporary data, like tracking a user's session on a website or maintaining login status during the session.  

   **Example:**
   ```javascript
   document.cookie = "username=JohnDoe; path=/;";
   ```
   In this example, the `username` cookie will be deleted as soon as the browser is closed because no expiration date is set.

2. **Persistent Cookies (When Expiration Is Set):**  
   If you specify an expiration date using the `Expires` attribute or a duration using the `Max-Age` attribute, the cookie becomes a persistent cookie.  
   - **Duration:** The cookie will remain in the browser until the specified time, even if the browser is closed and reopened.  
   - **Use Case:** Often used for storing user preferences, authentication tokens, or tracking data over a longer period.  

   **Example with `Expires`:**
   ```javascript
   document.cookie = "username=JohnDoe; expires=Fri, 31 Dec 2025 23:59:59 GMT; path=/;";
   ```

   **Example with `Max-Age`:**
   ```javascript
   document.cookie = "username=JohnDoe; max-age=86400; path=/;"; // Lasts for 1 day
   ```

### **Key Attributes for Cookie Expiration**

1. **`Expires`:**  
   Specifies the exact date and time when the cookie will expire. The date must follow the GMT format.
   - If the `Expires` date is set to a past date, the cookie is immediately deleted.

   **Example:**
   ```javascript
   document.cookie = "theme=dark; expires=Thu, 01 Jan 1970 00:00:00 UTC; path=/;";
   ```

2. **`Max-Age`:**  
   Specifies the lifetime of the cookie in seconds from the time it is set.  
   - This is more precise than `Expires` because it allows you to define a relative duration rather than an absolute date.

   **Example:**
   ```javascript
   document.cookie = "token=abc123; max-age=3600; path=/;"; // Expires in 1 hour
   ```

3. **Priority Between `Expires` and `Max-Age`:**  
   If both `Expires` and `Max-Age` are set, `Max-Age` takes precedence.

### **No Expiration: Temporary Storage**

When no expiration settings are provided, cookies are only stored temporarily as session cookies. These cookies:
- Are lightweight and cleared automatically when the user closes the browser.
- Cannot persist data across browser sessions, making them unsuitable for long-term storage.

### **Practical Scenarios for Expiration Settings**

1. **Session Management:**  
   Use session cookies to store temporary session data, like a userâ€™s login status:
   ```javascript
   document.cookie = "sessionId=abc123; path=/;";
   ```

2. **Remembering User Preferences:**  
   Use persistent cookies with a long expiration time to save user preferences, such as theme settings:
   ```javascript
   document.cookie = "theme=light; expires=Fri, 31 Dec 2025 23:59:59 GMT; path=/;";
   ```

3. **Authentication Tokens:**  
   Use `Max-Age` for secure token storage, ensuring the token is valid only for a specific period:
   ```javascript
   document.cookie = "authToken=xyz456; max-age=86400; secure; path=/;";
   ```

### **Conclusion**

The default expiration setting for cookies is session-based, meaning they are deleted when the browser is closed. However, by specifying an `Expires` or `Max-Age` attribute, you can create persistent cookies that remain stored for longer durations. Choosing the right expiration setting depends on the use case, balancing functionality with security and performance.
