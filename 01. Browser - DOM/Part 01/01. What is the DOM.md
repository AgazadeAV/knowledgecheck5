**What is the DOM?**

The DOM, which stands for Document Object Model, is a way browsers represent a web page. It’s like a map or a tree structure of the entire HTML document. Each element in the HTML—like headings, paragraphs, images, or links—is represented as a node in this tree. Even attributes, like `class` or `id`, and text are treated as nodes.

The DOM allows us to use JavaScript to interact with the page. For example, we can add or remove elements, change their styles, or update their content. It’s how websites become interactive and dynamic instead of just being static text and images.

In simple terms, the DOM is how the browser translates HTML into something we can manipulate with code. It’s an essential part of making modern, user-friendly web pages.
