**DOM Inspecting (Live DOM Viewer)**

DOM inspecting, or using a live DOM viewer, is a way to look at and interact with the structure of a webpage directly in the browser. Most modern browsers, like Chrome, Firefox, or Edge, have built-in developer tools that let you inspect the DOM. You can usually access them by right-clicking on a page and selecting "Inspect" or by pressing `F12`.

When you open the DOM inspector, you can see the entire structure of the page as a tree, just like the DOM itself. It shows all the elements, their attributes, and their relationships. You can also hover over elements in the tree to highlight them on the webpage, making it easier to see where they are.

One of the best parts of using a live DOM viewer is that it lets you edit the DOM in real-time. For example, you can change text, update styles, or add new elements directly in the browser to see how it affects the page. These changes don’t save to the original HTML file—they’re just temporary, which makes it a great tool for debugging and testing ideas.

In short, the live DOM viewer is an essential tool for web developers to understand, debug, and experiment with webpages.
