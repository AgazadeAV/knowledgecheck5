**What is the DOM Tree?**

The DOM tree is a visual representation of how a browser organizes the structure of a web page. It looks like an upside-down tree, where the root is the top element, usually the `<html>` tag. From there, all other elements, like `<head>`, `<body>`, paragraphs, images, and links, are connected as branches and leaves of the tree.

Each part of the HTML document, such as tags, attributes, and text, becomes a node in the DOM tree. For example, the `<body>` tag is a parent node, and its child nodes could be `<div>` or `<p>` elements. The browser uses this structure to understand the relationships between elements and how they fit together on the page.

The DOM tree is important because it allows JavaScript to access and manipulate specific parts of the page. For example, we can target a specific node in the tree, change its text, or even add new nodes. Itâ€™s the foundation of how interactive websites are created.
