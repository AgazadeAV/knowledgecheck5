### Read-Only Properties in TypeScript Interfaces

In TypeScript, **read-only properties** are a feature that allows you to create properties in an interface that cannot be modified after they are assigned. This is useful for ensuring that certain values remain constant throughout the lifecycle of an object, improving code safety and clarity.

---

### **1. What Are Read-Only Properties?**

A read-only property is defined by adding the `readonly` modifier before the property name in an interface. This modifier makes the property immutable after its initial assignment.

Example:
```typescript
interface User {
    readonly id: number;
    name: string;
}

const user: User = { id: 1, name: "John" };
console.log(user.id); // Output: 1

// user.id = 2; // Error: Cannot assign to 'id' because it is a read-only property
```
In this example, the `id` property is read-only, so any attempt to modify it will result in a compile-time error.

---

### **2. Why Use Read-Only Properties?**

Read-only properties are useful in scenarios where:
- You want to protect certain values from being accidentally modified.
- You need to create immutable data structures.
- You want to ensure the integrity of data, such as unique identifiers or configuration constants.

---

### **3. How Read-Only Properties Work**

When you use the `readonly` modifier, TypeScript ensures that the property can only be set during the object’s initialization, such as:
- Directly assigning values when the object is created.
- Using a constructor in a class that implements the interface.

Example:
```typescript
interface Product {
    readonly sku: string;
    name: string;
    price: number;
}

const product: Product = { sku: "ABC123", name: "Laptop", price: 1200 };
// product.sku = "XYZ456"; // Error: Cannot assign to 'sku' because it is a read-only property
```

---

### **4. Read-Only Arrays**

The `readonly` modifier can also be applied to arrays. This makes the array immutable, meaning its structure cannot be changed (e.g., no push, pop, or reassignment).

Example:
```typescript
const numbers: readonly number[] = [1, 2, 3];
console.log(numbers[0]); // Output: 1

// numbers.push(4); // Error: Property 'push' does not exist on type 'readonly number[]'
```
While you cannot modify the array structure, you can still read values from it.

---

### **5. Read-Only Properties in Classes**

Classes that implement an interface with read-only properties must follow the same rules. These properties can only be set inside the constructor.

Example:
```typescript
interface Car {
    readonly vin: string;
    model: string;
}

class Tesla implements Car {
    readonly vin: string;
    model: string;

    constructor(vin: string, model: string) {
        this.vin = vin;
        this.model = model;
    }
}

const car = new Tesla("12345ABC", "Model S");
console.log(car.vin); // Output: 12345ABC

// car.vin = "67890XYZ"; // Error: Cannot assign to 'vin' because it is a read-only property
```

---

### **6. Combining `readonly` with Other Features**

#### **Readonly with Optional Properties**
A property can be both `readonly` and optional. This means it can either be undefined or immutable if it exists.
```typescript
interface Config {
    readonly version?: string;
}

const config: Config = {};
// config.version = "1.0"; // Error: Cannot assign to 'version' because it is a read-only property
```

#### **Readonly with Type Aliases**
You can also use `readonly` with type aliases to create immutable object types.
```typescript
type Point = {
    readonly x: number;
    readonly y: number;
};

const point: Point = { x: 10, y: 20 };
// point.x = 30; // Error: Cannot assign to 'x' because it is a read-only property
```

---

### **7. Limitations of Read-Only Properties**

- **Only Shallow Immutability:** The `readonly` modifier applies only to the direct properties of an object. If a read-only property is an object, its nested properties can still be modified unless explicitly marked as read-only.
  ```typescript
  interface Book {
      readonly details: {
          title: string;
          author: string;
      };
  }

  const book: Book = { details: { title: "1984", author: "George Orwell" } };
  book.details.title = "Animal Farm"; // This is allowed
  ```

- **Runtime Behavior:** The `readonly` modifier only enforces immutability at compile time. It doesn’t prevent modifications at runtime unless you use additional libraries or patterns.

---

### **8. Practical Use Cases**

1. **Unique Identifiers:**
   ```typescript
   interface Entity {
       readonly id: string;
   }
   ```

2. **Immutable Configuration:**
   ```typescript
   interface AppConfig {
       readonly apiUrl: string;
       readonly version: string;
   }
   ```

3. **Constants:**
   ```typescript
   const PI: readonly number = 3.14;
   ```

---

### **9. Key Points to Remember**

1. Use the `readonly` modifier to prevent properties from being reassigned after initialization.
2. Read-only properties can only be set during object creation or in a constructor.
3. The `readonly` modifier provides compile-time safety but doesn’t enforce immutability at runtime.
4. Read-only properties are ideal for defining constants, unique identifiers, and immutable structures.

By understanding and using read-only properties effectively, you can write safer and more predictable TypeScript code.
