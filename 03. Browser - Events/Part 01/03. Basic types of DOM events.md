**Basic Types of DOM Events**

DOM events are a way to handle interactions and changes in a web page. These events are triggered by user actions, browser behavior, or other processes, and they allow developers to respond dynamically. Here are the basic types of DOM events you should know:

---

### **1. Mouse Events**
Mouse events are triggered by user interactions with a mouse, such as clicking, moving, or scrolling.

- **`click`**: Triggered when the user clicks an element.
  ```javascript
  button.addEventListener('click', () => {
      console.log('Button clicked!');
  });
  ```
- **`dblclick`**: Triggered when the user double-clicks an element.
- **`mouseover`**: Triggered when the mouse pointer moves over an element.
- **`mouseout`**: Triggered when the mouse pointer leaves an element.
- **`mousemove`**: Triggered when the mouse moves within an element.
- **`mousedown`** and **`mouseup`**: Triggered when a mouse button is pressed or released.

---

### **2. Keyboard Events**
Keyboard events are triggered when the user interacts with the keyboard.

- **`keydown`**: Triggered when a key is pressed.
- **`keyup`**: Triggered when a key is released.
- **`keypress`**: Deprecated but used to capture key presses (use `keydown` or `keyup` instead).

**Example:**
```javascript
document.addEventListener('keydown', (event) => {
    console.log(`Key pressed: ${event.key}`);
});
```

### **3. Form Events**
Form events are triggered by interactions with form elements, such as input fields, checkboxes, and buttons.

- **`submit`**: Triggered when a form is submitted.
  ```javascript
  form.addEventListener('submit', (event) => {
      event.preventDefault(); // Prevents the form from submitting
      console.log('Form submitted!');
  });
  ```
- **`change`**: Triggered when the value of an input or select element changes.
- **`input`**: Triggered when the user types or modifies an inputâ€™s value.
- **`focus`** and **`blur`**: Triggered when an element gains or loses focus.

### **4. Window Events**
These events are associated with the browser window and the document.

- **`load`**: Triggered when the entire page, including images and external resources, has fully loaded.
- **`DOMContentLoaded`**: Triggered when the HTML document is fully loaded and parsed.
- **`resize`**: Triggered when the browser window is resized.
- **`scroll`**: Triggered when the page or an element is scrolled.

**Example:**
```javascript
window.addEventListener('resize', () => {
    console.log('Window resized!');
});
```

---

### **5. Clipboard Events**
Clipboard events handle copying, cutting, and pasting content.

- **`copy`**: Triggered when content is copied.
- **`cut`**: Triggered when content is cut.
- **`paste`**: Triggered when content is pasted.

**Example:**
```javascript
document.addEventListener('copy', () => {
    console.log('Content copied!');
});
```

---

### **6. Media Events**
These events are related to audio and video elements.

- **`play`**: Triggered when media starts playing.
- **`pause`**: Triggered when media is paused.
- **`volumechange`**: Triggered when the volume of the media changes.

**Example:**
```javascript
video.addEventListener('play', () => {
    console.log('Video is playing!');
});
```

---

### **7. Drag and Drop Events**
These events handle dragging and dropping of elements.

- **`dragstart`**: Triggered when dragging starts.
- **`dragover`**: Triggered when an element is dragged over a valid drop target.
- **`drop`**: Triggered when the dragged element is dropped.

**Example:**
```javascript
element.addEventListener('dragstart', () => {
    console.log('Drag started!');
});
```

---

### **8. Touch Events**
Touch events are specific to devices with touchscreens.

- **`touchstart`**: Triggered when a touch starts.
- **`touchmove`**: Triggered when a touch moves across the screen.
- **`touchend`**: Triggered when a touch ends.

**Example:**
```javascript
document.addEventListener('touchstart', () => {
    console.log('Screen touched!');
});
```

### **Conclusion**
DOM events provide a wide range of tools to handle user interactions and browser changes. By understanding these basic event types, you can build dynamic and interactive web applications that respond to user behavior in real-time.
