**Event Propagation (Bubbling and Capturing)**

Event propagation describes how events flow through the DOM when triggered. It explains the order in which event handlers are called for elements that are nested within each other. Understanding event propagation is crucial for managing event handling effectively.

### **The Three Phases of Event Propagation**

When an event is triggered, it goes through three phases:

1. **Capturing Phase (Capture Phase):**  
   The event starts from the root of the DOM (e.g., `document`) and travels down to the target element. During this phase, the event is "captured" by the parent elements before reaching the target.

2. **Target Phase:**  
   The event reaches the target element. Handlers attached to the target element execute in this phase.

3. **Bubbling Phase:**  
   After reaching the target, the event "bubbles" back up to the root of the DOM. Handlers attached to the parent elements execute during this phase.

### **Event Bubbling**

In the bubbling phase, the event starts at the target element and propagates upward to its ancestors.

**Example:**
```javascript
document.querySelector('.child').addEventListener('click', () => {
    console.log('Child element clicked.');
});

document.querySelector('.parent').addEventListener('click', () => {
    console.log('Parent element clicked.');
});
```

If you click the `.child` element:
1. The event is handled by `.child`.
2. The event bubbles up to `.parent`, and its handler is executed.

---

### **Event Capturing**

In the capturing phase, the event starts at the root and travels down to the target element. To handle events during this phase, you need to specify the `capture` option when adding the event listener.

**Example:**
```javascript
document.querySelector('.parent').addEventListener(
    'click',
    () => {
        console.log('Parent element (capturing phase).');
    },
    true // Enable capturing phase
);
```

If you click the `.child` element, the handler on `.parent` will execute before the one on `.child`, because itâ€™s in the capturing phase.

### **Differences Between Bubbling and Capturing**

| **Aspect**            | **Bubbling**                        | **Capturing**                       |
|------------------------|-------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| **Order**              | Starts at the target and moves up. | Starts at the root and moves down. |
| **Default Behavior**   | Handlers are executed in this phase by default. | Requires `capture: true` to handle events. |

### **Stopping Propagation**

You can control the propagation of events using the following methods:

1. **`stopPropagation()`**: Stops the event from propagating further in either phase (bubbling or capturing).
   ```javascript
   document.querySelector('.child').addEventListener('click', (event) => {
       event.stopPropagation();
       console.log('Propagation stopped.');
   });
   ```

2. **`stopImmediatePropagation()`**: Stops the event from triggering any additional handlers on the same element and prevents it from propagating further.
   ```javascript
   document.querySelector('.child').addEventListener('click', (event) => {
       event.stopImmediatePropagation();
       console.log('No other handlers will run.');
   });
   ```

### **Practical Use of Propagation**

- **Event Delegation:**  
  Event bubbling is useful for event delegation, where a parent element handles events for its children. This reduces the need to attach listeners to individual child elements.
  ```javascript
  document.querySelector('.parent').addEventListener('click', (event) => {
      if (event.target.classList.contains('child')) {
          console.log('Child clicked via delegation.');
      }
  });
  ```

- **Capturing for Specific Use Cases:**  
  Capturing is less common but can be useful for intercepting events before they reach the target.

### **Conclusion**

Event propagation allows developers to manage how events flow through the DOM. Understanding the differences between bubbling and capturing, and how to control propagation, helps create efficient and maintainable event handling in web applications. This knowledge is especially important for techniques like event delegation and preventing unwanted behaviors.
