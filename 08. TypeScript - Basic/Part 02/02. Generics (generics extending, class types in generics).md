### Generics in TypeScript: Extending and Class Types in Generics

Generics in TypeScript are one of its most powerful features. They allow you to create reusable components while maintaining type safety. Sometimes, you need to restrict the types that can be used with a generic or work with class types in a generic context. This is where **generic constraints** and **class types in generics** come into play.

---

#### 1. **Generics with Constraints (Extending Generics)**

When you want a generic type to have specific properties or methods, you can use the `extends` keyword to impose constraints. This ensures that only types that meet the requirements can be used.

##### Example: Extending an Interface
Letâ€™s say we want to create a function that works only with objects that have a `length` property:
```typescript
function logLength<T extends { length: number }>(value: T): void {
    console.log(value.length);
}

logLength("Hello"); // Output: 5 (string has a length property)
logLength([1, 2, 3]); // Output: 3 (array has a length property)
// logLength(42); // Error: Type 'number' does not satisfy the constraint '{ length: number }'
```
Here, the constraint `{ length: number }` ensures that the generic `T` must have a `length` property.

---

##### Example: Extending a Custom Type
You can also extend a custom interface or type:
```typescript
interface Identifiable {
    id: number;
}

function printId<T extends Identifiable>(item: T): void {
    console.log(`ID: ${item.id}`);
}

printId({ id: 101, name: "John" }); // Output: ID: 101
// printId({ name: "John" }); // Error: Property 'id' is missing
```
This approach is useful when you want to enforce a specific structure for the input.

---

#### 2. **Using Multiple Constraints**

You can apply multiple constraints by extending multiple interfaces or types:
```typescript
interface Person {
    name: string;
}

interface Employee {
    employeeId: number;
}

function describeEmployee<T extends Person & Employee>(person: T): void {
    console.log(`${person.name} has employee ID: ${person.employeeId}`);
}

describeEmployee({ name: "Alice", employeeId: 123 }); // Valid
// describeEmployee({ name: "Alice" }); // Error: Property 'employeeId' is missing
```
In this case, the generic `T` must satisfy both `Person` and `Employee`.

---

#### 3. **Class Types in Generics**

Generics can also work with class types, allowing you to create reusable components for working with class instances.

##### Example: Generic Constraints with Classes
You can constrain a generic to accept only class types by using the `new()` constructor signature:
```typescript
class Animal {
    name: string;
    constructor(name: string) {
        this.name = name;
    }
}

class Dog extends Animal {
    bark(): void {
        console.log(`${this.name} says Woof!`);
    }
}

function createInstance<T extends Animal>(Class: new (name: string) => T, name: string): T {
    return new Class(name);
}

const myDog = createInstance(Dog, "Buddy");
myDog.bark(); // Output: Buddy says Woof!
```
Here, the `new()` signature ensures that the generic type `T` must be a class with a constructor that takes a `string` parameter.

---

#### 4. **Using Classes as Generics**

You can also define generic classes to handle multiple types while maintaining type safety:
```typescript
class Repository<T> {
    private items: T[] = [];

    add(item: T): void {
        this.items.push(item);
    }

    getAll(): T[] {
        return this.items;
    }
}

const numberRepo = new Repository<number>();
numberRepo.add(42);
numberRepo.add(99);
console.log(numberRepo.getAll()); // Output: [42, 99]

const stringRepo = new Repository<string>();
stringRepo.add("TypeScript");
stringRepo.add("Generics");
console.log(stringRepo.getAll()); // Output: ["TypeScript", "Generics"]
```
In this example, the `Repository` class works with any type, and TypeScript ensures that all items in the repository are of the same type.

---

#### 5. **Advanced Example: Generic Factory**

A more advanced example of using class types in generics is a factory function that creates instances of a class:
```typescript
function factory<T>(type: { new (): T }): T {
    return new type();
}

class User {
    name: string = "Default User";
}

const user = factory(User);
console.log(user.name); // Output: Default User
```
Here, the `factory` function accepts a class type and returns a new instance of that class.

---

#### 6. **Key Points to Remember**

- **Constraints with `extends`:** Use `extends` to restrict the types a generic can accept.
- **Class Types:** Use the `new()` signature to work with class constructors in generics.
- **Type Safety:** Generics ensure type safety while providing flexibility.
- **Reusability:** You can create reusable functions, classes, and interfaces using generics, reducing code duplication.

In summary, generics with constraints and class types make TypeScript even more powerful and versatile. They help you write type-safe and reusable code that works across various scenarios while ensuring strict type checks. Understanding these concepts is key to leveraging the full potential of TypeScript in real-world projects.
