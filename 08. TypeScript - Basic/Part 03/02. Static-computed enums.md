### Static and Computed Enums in TypeScript

Enums in TypeScript are a great way to define a set of named constants that can make your code more readable and maintainable. When working with enums, you may encounter two main types of members: **static** and **computed**. Understanding the difference between these is essential for writing clean and predictable code.

---

### **1. Static Enums**

Static enum members are those whose values are resolved at compile time. These members have fixed, constant values that do not depend on any runtime calculations. Static members can either be numeric or string values.

#### **Example of Static Numeric Enums**
```typescript
enum Direction {
    Up = 1,
    Down, // 2 (auto-incremented)
    Left, // 3
    Right // 4
}

console.log(Direction.Up);    // Output: 1
console.log(Direction.Right); // Output: 4
```
In this example, the enum values are determined at compile time. `Down`, `Left`, and `Right` are auto-incremented based on the value of `Up`.

---

#### **Example of Static String Enums**
```typescript
enum Colors {
    Red = "RED",
    Green = "GREEN",
    Blue = "BLUE"
}

console.log(Colors.Red);   // Output: "RED"
console.log(Colors.Green); // Output: "GREEN"
```
For string enums, each member must have an explicitly assigned string value, which remains constant and is known at compile time.

---

### **2. Computed Enums**

Computed enum members are those whose values are determined at runtime. These members involve expressions, function calls, or calculations.

#### **Example of Computed Members**
```typescript
enum FilePermissions {
    Read = 1 << 0,  // 1 (binary: 0001)
    Write = 1 << 1, // 2 (binary: 0010)
    Execute = 1 << 2, // 4 (binary: 0100)
    All = Read | Write | Execute // 7 (binary: 0111)
}

console.log(FilePermissions.All); // Output: 7
```
In this example, `All` is a computed member because its value is calculated using bitwise operations on the other enum members.

---

#### **Mixed Static and Computed Enums**
You can combine static and computed members in the same enum:
```typescript
enum Sizes {
    Small = 10,
    Medium = Small * 2, // 20
    Large = Medium + 10, // 30
    ExtraLarge = Math.pow(Large, 2) // Computed at runtime
}

console.log(Sizes.ExtraLarge); // Output: 900
```
Here, `Small`, `Medium`, and `Large` are static, while `ExtraLarge` is computed using a runtime calculation.

### **Key Differences Between Static and Computed Enums**

| Feature                 | Static Enums                   | Computed Enums                   |
|-------------------------|---------------------------------|-----------------------------------|
| **Value Determination** | Resolved at compile time       | Determined at runtime            |
| **Performance**         | Faster, as values are pre-computed | Slower, as values are computed at runtime |
| **Usage**               | Simple constants               | When calculations are needed      |

---

### **3. Limitations of Computed Enums**

1. **Order of Members:** In an enum, all computed members must come **after** static members. If a computed member appears first, TypeScript cannot auto-increment subsequent members:
   ```typescript
   enum Example {
       Computed = Math.random(), // Error if followed by static members
       Static = 10
   }
   ```
   To fix this, place static members first or explicitly assign values to all members.

2. **Cannot Be Reverse-Mapped:** Computed members cannot be reverse-mapped because their values may not uniquely correspond to their names:
   ```typescript
   enum ComputedExample {
       A = Math.random(),
       B = Math.random()
   }

   console.log(ComputedExample[0.5]); // Undefined
   ```

---

### **4. Practical Use Cases**

#### **Static Enums**
- Used for defining constants like days of the week, user roles, or fixed configuration options.
  ```typescript
  enum UserRole {
      Admin = "ADMIN",
      User = "USER",
      Guest = "GUEST"
  }
  ```

#### **Computed Enums**
- Useful for creating flags or values that depend on calculations or bitwise operations.
  ```typescript
  enum PermissionFlags {
      None = 0,
      Read = 1,
      Write = 2,
      ReadWrite = Read | Write // Computed
  }
  ```

---

### **5. Summary**

- **Static enums** are simple and efficient, with values determined at compile time.
- **Computed enums** provide flexibility for runtime calculations but are slightly slower and less predictable.
- Use static enums for most cases where predefined constants are sufficient.
- Use computed enums when values depend on calculations, especially for flags or dynamic configurations.

By combining static and computed enums effectively, you can write cleaner, more expressive TypeScript code that balances simplicity and power.
