### Union Types in TypeScript

Union types in TypeScript are a powerful feature that allows us to specify that a variable can hold one of several types. This is really useful when we’re working with data that can have different types depending on the situation.

---

#### 1. **What is a Union Type?**

A union type is created by using the `|` symbol between two or more types. It means that the variable can be any one of those types. For example:
```typescript
let value: string | number;
```
Here, the variable `value` can either be a `string` or a `number`.

---

#### 2. **Why Use Union Types?**

Union types are helpful when a variable might not always have the same type, such as when working with APIs, user input, or conditional logic.

For instance, a function that processes IDs could accept either a `string` or a `number`:
```typescript
function printId(id: string | number): void {
    console.log(`Your ID is: ${id}`);
}
```
This makes the function flexible and reusable.

#### 3. **How to Work with Union Types**

When using union types, it’s important to handle each type explicitly. TypeScript doesn’t assume what type it is—you have to check or narrow it. For example:
```typescript
function processValue(value: string | number): void {
    if (typeof value === "string") {
        console.log(value.toUpperCase());
    } else {
        console.log(value.toFixed(2));
    }
}
```
Here, `typeof` is used to check if `value` is a `string` or a `number`, so we can safely call methods like `toUpperCase` or `toFixed`.

---

#### 4. **Union Types with Custom Types**

Union types aren’t just limited to built-in types. They can also be used with custom types. For example:
```typescript
type Status = "success" | "error" | "loading";
let currentStatus: Status;
currentStatus = "success"; // Valid
currentStatus = "error";   // Valid
currentStatus = "done";    // Error: Type '"done"' is not assignable to type 'Status'.
```
This is a great way to ensure that your code only uses valid values.

---

#### 5. **Combining Union Types with Functions**

You can use union types in function parameters and return values to increase flexibility. For example:
```typescript
function getLength(input: string | string[]): number {
    return typeof input === "string" ? input.length : input.length;
}
```
In this function, we check if the input is a `string` or an array of strings and then return the appropriate length.

---

#### 6. **Common Use Cases for Union Types**

- **API responses:** When an API might return different types of data depending on the request.
- **User input:** When users can provide input in different formats.
- **Optional properties:** To indicate that a property can be a specific type or `undefined`:
  ```typescript
  let optionalValue: string | undefined;
  ```

---

#### 7. **Limitations of Union Types**

While union types are flexible, they don’t automatically merge all methods or properties from the included types. You need to explicitly check or cast types to access specific methods.

---

In summary, union types are a simple yet powerful way to handle multiple types in TypeScript. They make our code more flexible while still ensuring type safety, and they’re especially useful when dealing with unpredictable or dynamic data. By properly using union types, you can write cleaner, more adaptable code.
