### Basic Types in TypeScript

TypeScript provides several basic types that are essential for creating robust and type-safe applications. Here’s a breakdown of some key types, including their purpose and use cases:

#### 1. **Void**
The `void` type is used to represent the absence of any value. It is often used as the return type for functions that do not return anything. For example:
```typescript
function logMessage(message: string): void {
    console.log(message);
}
```
Here, `logMessage` performs an action but does not return any value.

---

#### 2. **Never**
The `never` type represents values that never occur. This is typically used for functions that throw errors or have infinite loops, making it impossible for the function to return anything.
```typescript
function throwError(message: string): never {
    throw new Error(message);
}
```
In this case, the function always throws an error, so it never successfully completes.

---

#### 3. **Unknown**
The `unknown` type is a safer version of `any`. It can hold any value, but you must perform type checks before using it. This is particularly useful when you’re dealing with dynamic or uncertain data.
```typescript
let someValue: unknown = "Hello, TypeScript";

if (typeof someValue === "string") {
    console.log(someValue.toUpperCase());
}
```
Unlike `any`, `unknown` forces you to validate the type before performing operations on the value.

---

#### 4. **Tuple**
Tuples are fixed-length arrays where each element has a specific type. They are useful for representing structured data.
```typescript
let user: [number, string] = [1, "John"];
```
In this example, `user` must always have a `number` as the first element and a `string` as the second.

---

#### 5. **Any**
The `any` type allows a variable to hold any type of value. While it provides flexibility, it should be avoided when possible because it bypasses TypeScript's type-checking features.
```typescript
let anything: any = 42;
anything = "Now I'm a string!";
```
Using `any` is risky as it reduces the benefits of TypeScript’s static typing.

---

#### 6. **Null and Undefined**
`null` and `undefined` are types in TypeScript that represent the absence of a value. By default, these types are included in all other types unless you use the `strictNullChecks` option.
```typescript
let a: undefined = undefined;
let b: null = null;
```

---

#### 7. **Union Types**
Union types allow a variable to hold multiple types. This is particularly useful when a value can be of more than one type.
```typescript
let value: string | number;
value = "Hello";
value = 123;
```

---

#### 8. **Literal Types**
Literal types allow you to specify exact values a variable can hold, often used with unions to create restricted sets of values.
```typescript
type Direction = "up" | "down" | "left" | "right";
let move: Direction = "up";
```

These are the foundational types provided by TypeScript. They help developers write clean, predictable, and error-free code. By understanding these types and their use cases, you can make the most out of TypeScript's powerful type system.
