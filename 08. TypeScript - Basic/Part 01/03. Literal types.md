### Literal Types in TypeScript

Literal types in TypeScript are a way to specify that a variable or value can only hold a specific, predefined value. This helps make your code more predictable and type-safe because you’re restricting the possible values a variable can take.

---

#### 1. **What Are Literal Types?**

Literal types allow you to define variables that can only be assigned specific values. These values can be strings, numbers, or booleans. For example:
```typescript
let direction: "left" | "right" | "up" | "down";
direction = "left";  // Valid
direction = "forward"; // Error: Type '"forward"' is not assignable to type '"left" | "right" | "up" | "down"'.
```

In this case, the `direction` variable can only take one of the four string values: `"left"`, `"right"`, `"up"`, or `"down"`.

---

#### 2. **Why Use Literal Types?**

Literal types are useful when you want to limit the options for a variable to a specific set of values. This reduces bugs and ensures that only valid data is used. It’s especially helpful when working with configuration settings, APIs, or enums.

---

#### 3. **Combining Literal Types with Union Types**

Literal types work well with union types to create more specific constraints. For example:
```typescript
type ButtonSize = "small" | "medium" | "large";
let size: ButtonSize;
size = "medium";  // Valid
size = "extra-large"; // Error
```
Here, `ButtonSize` acts like a custom type with only three allowed values.

---

#### 4. **Literal Types with Functions**

You can use literal types as function parameters or return types to ensure only specific values are passed or returned:
```typescript
function setStatus(status: "success" | "error" | "loading"): void {
    console.log(`Status set to: ${status}`);
}
setStatus("success");  // Valid
setStatus("pending");  // Error
```
This ensures that the `setStatus` function only accepts predefined status values.

---

#### 5. **Literal Types with Numbers and Booleans**

Literal types aren’t limited to strings. You can also use numbers and booleans:
```typescript
let retries: 0 | 1 | 2 | 3;
retries = 2;  // Valid
retries = 5;  // Error

let isActive: true | false;
isActive = true;  // Valid
isActive = false; // Valid
```

---

#### 6. **Literal Types with Type Aliases**

To make your code more readable and reusable, you can use `type` aliases with literal types:
```typescript
type TrafficLight = "red" | "yellow" | "green";
let light: TrafficLight;
light = "red";  // Valid
light = "blue"; // Error
```

Using type aliases makes it easier to maintain and update your code, especially when the same set of values is used in multiple places.

---

#### 7. **Literal Types with Inference**

TypeScript can infer literal types when you explicitly define a constant:
```typescript
const mode = "dark"; // The type of `mode` is "dark"
```
However, for variables, TypeScript defaults to a broader type unless explicitly specified:
```typescript
let theme = "light"; // Type is string, not "light"
```
To enforce the literal type, you can use `as const`:
```typescript
const theme = "light" as const; // Type is "light"
```

---

#### 8. **Advantages of Literal Types**

- **Improved Type Safety:** They prevent invalid values from being assigned.
- **Better Documentation:** They make the allowed values explicit and easier to understand.
- **Reduced Bugs:** By limiting values to a specific set, you minimize the chance of errors.

---

#### 9. **Limitations of Literal Types**

While literal types are great for specific use cases, they might not be suitable for dynamic or large sets of values. For example, if you have hundreds of valid values, an enum or a broader type might be more practical.

---

In summary, literal types in TypeScript are a simple but powerful feature for restricting values to a specific set. They work well with union types, functions, and type aliases, making your code more predictable and reliable. By understanding and using literal types, you can write cleaner and safer TypeScript code.
